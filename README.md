# README #

The node parser is a powerful node based language parser library built upon Irony. The NodeParser is used in [SolScript](https://bitbucket.org/PatrickSachs/solscript/)

### Where is the documentation? ###

Sadly, as of now there is none. I will add documentation once SolScript has reached a proper release version and I am fully confident that the NodeParser is feature complete.

However, I recorded a YouTube video going over the basics of the NodeParser if you are interested: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foufYNOaP64](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=foufYNOaP64)
